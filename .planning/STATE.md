## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- None yet — see PROJECT.md Key Decisions for architectural decisions made during initialization.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: Confirm exact `POST /v1/uploads/presign` request/response shape (field names, whether `count: N` returns array or map) against API docs before implementation
- Phase 4/5: Confirm exact shapes of `DocumentScanResult`, `FaceCompareResult`, and `IdentityVerificationResult` from the API reference before writing Zod schemas
- Phase 1: Decide whether to bundle `@deepidv/core` into `@deepidv/server` via tsup `noExternal` (eliminates workspace protocol stripping risk) before designing the publishing pipeline
